# Synonyms Dataset
The dataset is a set of 500 synsets (extracted from the Arabic Wordnet). Each synset is enriched with a list of candidate synonyms. The total number is 3K candidates. Each candidate synonym is then annotated with a fuzzy value by four linguists (in parallel). The dataset is important for understanding how much linguists (dis/)agree on synonymy (which we found RMSE: 32% and MAE: 27%). In addition, we used the dataset as a baseline to evaluate our algorithm. See the scoring guidelines, figures, and details in the paper section 3.<br />
